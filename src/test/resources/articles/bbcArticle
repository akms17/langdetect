David Cameron has said migration can be managed if the UK remains inside the EU and it would be "madness" to try to control it by voting to leave.
He said he did not accept that his pledge to cut immigration below 100,000 could not be achieved within the EU.
In a live Q&A on Sky News, he said leaving the EU and the single market would "trash" the UK economy.
Vote Leave's Iain Duncan Smith said the studio audience were "fed up with the scaremongering" of the Remain campaign.
'Right ambition'
The live Q&A and questions from a studio audience on Sky News was Mr Cameron's first major TV event of the EU referendum campaign.
Justice Secretary Michael Gove has admitted he is feeling "nervous" as he prepares to take part in a similar programme on the channel on Friday evening but says he is hoping to "allay people's fears" about leaving the EU.
